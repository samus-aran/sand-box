        Welcome! This space is just for introductions—say hi, share what you’re excited about, and meet other folks.

        **Quick nudge:** if your post is really “how do I use GitHub?” or troubleshooting something, please use **New to GitHub** (or the most relevant help category) so you can get the best answers.

        **Privacy & safety:** please don’t share sensitive personal info (addresses, phone numbers, private emails, etc.).

        **One intro per person:** make one intro post and feel free to add updates as replies anytime.

        Keep it friendly and human: a couple links are fine, but let *you* be the main event (no link-dumping, recruiting, or promo-only posts).
