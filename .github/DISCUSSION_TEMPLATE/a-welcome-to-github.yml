        Welcome! This space is **just** for introductions! So say hi and share what you’re excited about here on GitHub.
        - **Quick nudge:** if your post is really “how do I use GitHub?” or troubleshooting something, please use **New to GitHub** (or the most relevant help category) so you can get the best answers.
        - **Privacy & safety:** please don’t share sensitive personal info (addresses, phone numbers, private emails, etc.).
        - **One intro per person:** make one intro post and feel free to add updates as replies anytime.
        
        Keep it friendly and human: a couple links are fine, but let *you* be the main event (no link-dumping, recruiting, or promo-only posts).
